# GAMMA-Loadout-Overhaul
A loadout overhaul for the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly Modpack: G.A.M.M.A.! Changes all of the enemy drops and player starting options to, ideally, decrease gun bloat and create newer more interesting options!

## What's this addon do?

The goal of this addon is to reduce the amount of "Weapon Bloat" in GAMMA, most notably in the form of reducing variants that are just objectively worse versions of other guns (Saiga Nerd vs Saiga Merc), variants that don't feel unique to other guns in the game (A lot of the AK-74 Variants), or to just reduce the amount of weapons in overcompetitive spots (Pistols).
This, ideally, will also fix finding a lot of "Debug Only" weapons on enemies also.
