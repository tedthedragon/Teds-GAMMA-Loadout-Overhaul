# Ted's G.A.M.M.A. Loadout Overhaul

A loadout overhaul for the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly Modpack: G.A.M.M.A.! Changes all of the enemy drops and player starting options to, ideally, decrease gun bloat and create newer more interesting options!

## What does this change?

This affects all of the NPC loadouts and mostly replaces weapons in GAMMA with others, an example being that it replaces ``wpn_p90_gs`` (Integrated Red-Dot Optic P90) with ``wpn_p90gamma`` (Green Picatinny Rail P90).
This has the intention of decreasing the actual amount of different guns there are in GAMMA while not decreasing notably different options to the player, as most of my replacements intend to replace the weapons with either a variant of itself, like in the case of the P90, or something that is functionally identical to it, like a lot of the 5.56 and 5.45 weapons.
This also removes weapons I view as overpowered currently like the AMB-17 and RD-939 to promote different options like the VSS and AS-Val for lategame.

## Is this compatible with (insert mod here)?

This should, ideally, be compatible with anything that adds stuff to loadouts, though stuff like **F.W.P.** and BaS 2022 are currently untested by myself. In the future I may make patches for them, but there is no guarentee on that.

## How do I install this?

Add it to the bottom of your load order, ideally before any other weapon mods or new game loadout modifiers, in MO2. To add it either use Ctrl + M or the add archive button in the top left.

## I don't like (x change) / It doesn't work!

If you dislike something or the mod doesn't work on your end, I suggest either simply not using it or bringing it up in its respective thread in the Stalker GAMMA discord. Chances are if it's relating to a weapon I removed I will not change my stance on removing it, though I am happy to hear feedback.
